# SolidityModule
Final assessment for Getting Started with Solidity. A basic implementation of a token system that allows minting and burning of tokens.  It demonstrates the process of minting and burning tokens, as well as how to maintain a balance of tokens for different addresses. 


## Description

The MyToken contract allows the creation and destruction of tokens using two primary functions: mint and burn.
- The mint function increases the total supply of tokens and assigns them to a specific address.
- The burn function reduces the total supply by removing tokens from a specific address, ensuring the address has enough tokens before the operation.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the program using Remix, an online Solidity IDE:

1. Create a file named MyToken.sol in Remix and paste the contract code into it.

2. Ensure to select the appropriate Solidity version (0.8.18) and compile the code.

3. Deploy the contract.
   
4. Interact with the contract. Use the mint function to add tokens to an address. Use the burn function to remove tokens from an address, ensuring the address has enough tokens to burn. 
    You can also check balances of any address by using the balances mapping
